# Full Stack PWA Text Editor


This project, which I named Full Stack PWA Text Editor, is part of the Module 18 Challenge for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. My name is Eric Rothmuller and I am a student of the Boot Camp. In this project I was tasked with creating a text editor that is a progressive web application.
